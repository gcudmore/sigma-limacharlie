    description: Detects suspicious uses of the SysInternals Procdump utility by using
      a special command line parameter ' -ma ' and ' -accepteula' in a single step.
      This way we're also able to catch cases in which the attacker has renamed the
      procdump executable.
    falsepositives:
    - Another tool that uses the command line switches of Procdump
    - Legitimate use of procdump by a developer or administrator
