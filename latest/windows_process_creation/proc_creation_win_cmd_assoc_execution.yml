    description: 'Detects file association changes using the builtin "assoc" command.

      When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file (also called
      the file association or handler) is checked. File association selections are
      stored in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or
      programs that have Registry access or by administrators using the built-in assoc
      utility. Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension
      to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.
