    description: Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe
      the processing and rendering of data within XML files. Rule detects when adversaries
      abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing
      application whitelisting defenses.
    falsepositives:
    - WMIC.exe FP depend on scripts and administrative methods used in the monitored
      environment.
    - msxsl.exe is not installed by default, so unlikely.
