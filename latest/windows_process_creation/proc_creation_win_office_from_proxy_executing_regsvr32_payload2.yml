    description: Excel called wmic to finally proxy execute regsvr32 with the payload.
      An attacker wanted to break suspicious parent-child chain (Office app spawns
      LOLBin).But we have command-line in the event which allow us to "restore" this
      suspicious parent-child chain and detect it. Monitor process creation with "wmic
      process call create" and LOLBins in command-line with parent Office application
      processes.
