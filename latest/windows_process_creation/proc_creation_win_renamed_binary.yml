    description: Detects the execution of a renamed binary often used by attackers
      or malware leveraging new Sysmon OriginalFileName datapoint.
    falsepositives:
    - Custom applications use renamed binaries adding slight change to binary name.
      Typically this is easy to spot and add to whitelist
    - PsExec installed via Windows Store doesn't contain original filename field (False
      negative)
